### We are a Astrophysics team under SSERD IPD working on finding a relation that accounts for the mass transfer from a companion star to a black hole, which would help us conclude the mass conservation and find if there is any discrepancy, which we call as the ghost mass and use reference systems for validation of ghost mass problem and accounting for the discrepancy using models/computation.
